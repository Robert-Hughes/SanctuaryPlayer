# This file defines search indexes for queries using Google Datastore
# I think this is supposed to be picked up automatically, but it seems that I had to force it manually: python E:\Programming\google-cloud-sdk\lib\gcloud.py --project sanctuary-player datastore indexes create .\index.yaml
# See https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/tools/indexconfig#Datastore_Updating_indexes
# Note this file must be named "index.yaml" (otherwise the above command will fail, even if you specify the different file name)

indexes:

- kind: SavedPosition
  properties:
  - name: user_id
